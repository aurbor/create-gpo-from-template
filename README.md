> Backup and Create GPO for distribution

These two scripts are used to Export an existing GPO, and then create the same GPO on a destination domain controller.

## GPO-Backup.ps1

Download just this script to get started!

This script will create a backup/export of an existing GPO with the name 'Software Restrictions' on an existing Domain Controller. Create your GPO, name it 'Software Restrictions', and then run this script on the domain controller to export the existing object, download the deployment script, and then package the exported GPO and deployment script into a ZIP Archive that can be distributed for GPO deployment.

## GPO-Creation.ps1

Included in the deployment package created by the script above. This script will create a new GPO on the destination domain controller, link it to the root of the domain, and then import the settings from the GPO created using the 'GPO-Backup.ps1' script.

## Usage example

* Login to any Domain Controller
* Create a GPO called 'Software Restrictions'
* Modify the GPO to include the settings you want to replicate on other DCs
* Download the 'GPO-Backup.ps1' script into a folder on the source domain controller
* Run the script with no parameters
* The resulting package will be available in the 'Packages' subfolder where the script was downloaded to.
* Distribute the Package (ZIP archive) to destination domain controllers.
* Extract the contents, and run the GPO-Create.ps1 script.
* Verify that a 'Software Restrictions' GPO has been created in the destination environment with the correct settings.
* Link the GPO to whatever containers you require.
